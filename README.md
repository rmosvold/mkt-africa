# mkt-africa
This repository contains documentation and source files for a review of research on mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) in Africa. The repository has two primary purposes: 1) to ensure transparency and credibility of an ongoing literature review by making all source files available, and 2) to share source files for inspiration to future literature reviews. 

The manuscript included is a draft version of a manuscript that has been submitted to African Journal of Teacher Education and Development (https://ajoted.org). Please contact the repository owner about proper reference!
