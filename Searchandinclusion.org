** Search 1
I first made an initial search in the Eric database, with the following search terms for peer-reviewed journal articles:

#+begin_src
"mathematical knowledge for teaching" AND location:"Africa" pubyearmin:2014 pubyearmax:2021
#+end_src

This only gave [[https://eric.ed.gov/?q=%22mathematical+knowledge+for+teaching%22+AND+location%3a%22Africa%22+pubyearmin%3a2014+pubyearmax%3a2021&pr=on&ff1=pubJournal+Articles][6 hits]]. I used this as a starting point for fine-tuning the search in a second search phase. 

** Search 2
I then made an extended search in Eric for peer-reviewed journal articles in English, that were published between 2014 and 2021. Search terms were “mathematics AND knowledge AND teaching” in the abstract, and in addition “Africa” as location identifier. This search gave [[https://eric.ed.gov/?q=abstract%3a%22mathematics%22+AND+abstract%3a%22knowledge%22+AND+abstract%3a%22teaching%22+AND+location%3a%22Africa%22+pubyearmin%3a2014+pubyearmax%3a2021&pr=on&ff1=pubJournal+Articles][79 hits]].

** Search 3
In addition to the structured searches above, I conducted manual searches in AJRMSTE and Pythagoras journals. In AJRMSTE, I got 15 hits for the search term “mathematical knowledge for teaching”, 10 that were published between 2014 and 2021. In Pythagoras, I got 31 hits for the same search term, but few seem directly relevant.

Below are the hits from my search in AJRMSTE:

The study involved the pedagogic practice of one teacher teaching linear functions to his class of grade 10 learners in a secondary school in Gauteng, South Africa. Drawing on a theory of pedagogic discourse, we worked from the assumption that pedagogic judgement is a necessary element of pedagogic communication, operationalised through evaluation (in the broad sense), and requiring appeals to some or other ground to substantiate meaning. We studied `evaluative events' in this practice, and the kinds of appeals made by the teacher over time. We argue that these provide for a systematic description of mathematics for teaching in use in this practice. Implications for developing our understanding of the specificity of mathematics used in teaching are drawn, as well as for mathematics teacher education in a context of curriculum change.},

Findings indicate that the mathematics education research community has become more established, expanding quantitatively, with the number of articles identified being nearly double, in absolute terms, that in a similar review of research from 2000 to 2006. Trends identified in the earlier review persist, with a dominance of publications in local journals and on small-scale qualitative studies on secondary teaching and learning. There is, importantly, an increase in research on primary mathematics. The review includes critical reflection on these findings, opportunities and threats, new and old, and what these mean for the future of research in this field.},

Its authors report recent (2000\textendash 2006) research into the education of science and mathematics teachers in this country. International research trends provide a frame for the survey. Findings suggest that most of the research in both science and mathematics teacher education consists of small scale qualitative studies, generally conducted in urban contexts and among teachers participating in formal in-service programmes. In science teacher education, research emphases appear to have shifted towards process skill development, nature of science (NOS) and indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) while still acknowledging the importance of content knowledge. In mathematics teacher education research, there is a strong emphasis on the specificity of mathematical knowledge for mathematics teaching and teacher learning, with curriculum reform recently in focus in both mathematics and science teacher education literature. Gaps in the research have also been identified, including the education of primary mathematics and science teachers, teacher education for life sciences and the education of teachers in and for rural contexts. The authors argue for further research into mathematics and science teacher education and conclude with a research agenda focused on an examination of teacher education practices, investigations into primary teacher education, studies into life sciences teacher education and empirical research across diverse schooling contexts, with particular attention being paid to rural education.},

From a selective review of literature, reasons are examined as to why less emphasis appears to have been placed on generating knowledge about teaching and effective mathematical teaching practices than on mathematics teachers and their knowledge. Possible reasons for this lack of attention to teaching include assumptions that, as researchers, we already know what effective teaching is or that if teachers embrace certain principles about teaching or learning, then effective teaching will necessarily ensue. Arguing that both of these positions neglect to address important aspects of developing knowledge about effective teaching, the paper raises a number of questions that research might address in moving the balance more towards examining the actual practices that might characterise effective teaching.},

Pre-service teachers were introduced to the Six Lens Framework as a tool to aid reflection on mathematics teaching. The authors compared two sets of reflections written by four pre-service teachers (PSTs) who participated in the study. One set was based on a video-recorded lesson of another teacher's practice while the other was based on a video-recording of their own practice. The study found that the PSTs' reflections in both cases were generally at the lowest level of the reflection spectrum. They mostly described classroom events rather than analysing the lessons to provide explanation suggestions, or reflectivity. We found, however, that all four PSTs reflected at substantially greater length on their own lessons than on those of other teachers. Furthermore, three of the four teachers' reflections on their own practice focused on mathematical rather than general aspects and provided more suggestions for improvement than their reflections on the practice of other teachers.},

Written answers to a questionnaire survey, and data from six individual interviews collected at the beginning of the teacher-training programme will be presented. The analytical framework is based on the practice-based theory of mathematical knowledge for teaching, with a specific focus on the domains of the common, horizon and specialised content knowledge. The data revealed that, while taking theoretical courses, pre-service teaches develop only intuitive but complementary views of what is proposed by the theory, which is even the case with pre-service teachers with some prior teaching experience. Findings provide insights into the development of pre-service teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching, and suggest that further research is needed on how pre-service teachers articulate their understanding of teaching in practice.},

Relevant literature is reviewed, and theoretical perspectives with investigative value for classroom management are examined. Data was collected using individual semi-structured interviews with four Mathematics department heads and with five teachers per school, for the four focus group interviews. The interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and the data analysed using a process of abductive data analysis as suggested by McMillan and Schumacher (2010; Research in education: Evidence-based inquiry, 4th ed., Pearson Education). The participants in this study supported the use of different overlapping management styles. Teachers apply these styles by introducing useful and suitable management actions in their classroom practice. It was found that organising group work and motivating learners are actions that encompass the majority of functions related to the management of teaching and learning in Mathematics classrooms. Contextual influences like teachers' professional competencies, curriculum implementation, the maintenance of facilities and the availability of resources and learning materials were highlighted as factors that both support and constrain the effectiveness of classroom management.},

In doing so, we use the framework to categorise and comment on the research studies and determine the applicability of the framework to science and mathematics classrooms. Our review findings show that the framework's constructs of `profile of implementation' and `capacity to innovate' can be applied, with some adaptation, to both mathematics and science classroom studies. Fewer studies have involved the third construct `outside support'. We conclude that there is an inevitable dislocation between policy and curriculum implementation, and that the framework provides a useful notion of `feasible implementation' by suggesting how (in a series of small steps) individual schools can put into practice new curriculum policy.},

An in-depth study was deployed with one mathematics teacher and her grade 8 class of 20 learners solving mathematical word problems. Data were collected using a single-case design with semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and observations before, during and after two lessons. The help-seeking behaviour was conceptualised and analysed using 11 dimensions (clustered into 4 aspects) as used in the work by Gurtner. The four aspects include: intention to seek help; source of help (teacher vs classmate); type of help (hints and/or self-regulatory content knowledge) and reasons for help-seeking avoidance. The analyses indicate that the teacher had detailed knowledge of her learners' intended help-seeking behaviour. In many instances this teacher's knowledge of the source of help was congruent with learners' actual help-seeking. The congruency was taken to indicate how accurate knowledge on the part of the teacher can aid interaction and learning support. The teacher data provided evidence to expand Gurtner's 11 dimensions to 13, providing two additional reasons for help-seeking avoidance by the learners. These are termed `uncaring' (referring to lack of engagement on the part of the learners) and `ignorance' (referring to a lack of meta-cognitive awareness that help is needed).},

We studied seven video-recorded circle geometry lessons taught by the teacher and analysed these first using an LCE framework and then the Mathematics Discourse in Instruction (MDI) framework, adapted to suit the analysis of geometry lessons. The LCE analysis revealed that while the lessons were undoubtedly teacher-centred, they were not at the extreme end of an LCE continuum. Analysis using an adapted MDI framework showed that the teacher's use of mediational means opened opportunities to learn mathematics. We argue that LCE frameworks are useful in mathematics education research as they do not dichotomise teaching practices, but they are insufficient. They can obscure opportunities made available to learn mathematics. Frameworks that illuminate such opportunities are needed to fully describe mathematics teaching practices. Furthermore, we identified links between the elements of LCE exhibited and the mathematical mediational means in use. These suggest that supporting teachers to strengthen their mathematical mediational means in use could enable movement towards more learner-centered teaching.},

One possible factor that might have an influence on their mathematics achievement is the conceptual knowledge of mathematics teachers. In order to facilitate conceptual understanding, mathematics teachers themselves must possess profound mathematical knowledge. One key aspect of the complex landscape of pre-service mathematics teacher education is the development of pre-service teachers' mathematical knowledge. Various studies have suggested that pre-service teachers need to be exposed to the meaningful learning of mathematics as a way to develop their mathematical knowledge for teaching. By using a mixed methods approach, this study examined the influence of a technologically enhanced learning environment on the conceptual understanding of mathematical functions of pre-service mathematics teachers. Using a hybrid model of O'Callaghan's framework and Dreyfus's typology, pre-service teachers were tested on the modelling, interpretation, translation and reifying of functions. Data were gathered from a pre-post-test, as well as from task-based interviews. The results revealed that there was no improvement in the first three components, but a significant improvement in the reification component.},

  abstract = {What teachers teach, how they teach it and when they teach it should be guided by the curriculum. This paper focuses on teachers' reports about how they integrate the curriculum documentation in teaching mathematics and statistics concepts. Questionnaires containing both Likert scale and closed and open-ended questions were administered to 75 mathematics teachers who were teaching from Grade 4 to Grade 12 in schools in KwaZulu\textendash Natal province in South Africa. Teachers were requested to indicate their level of the use of national curriculum statement. The findings revealed that they had little idea about how they could integrate the curriculum documentation in mathematics teaching and learning. It is encouraging that some teachers perceived links within the vertical as well as across the horizontal curriculum, both important drivers of quality education. However, it is a concern that most teachers were unable to perceive ways of working within and across the curriculum, suggesting that professional development interventions need to consider ways in which this can be addressed. A further concern is that only 60\% of teachers indicated that they used the National Curriculum Statements Grades R\textendash 12. Teachers' propensity to use the curriculum was moderated by the factors of age and participation in professional development activities.},

  abstract = {This article reports on a study that investigated the extent to which 57 Grade 6 students at a particular school have misconceptions regarding equality, with the equal sign as focus. It also investigated this school's three Grade 5 and 6 teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching regarding equality, again focusing on the equal sign. The research took the form of a case study in which a qualitative approach was used. Data collection methods included teacher questionnaires and a focus group interview with teachers. Students answered a set of questions after which six students were purposefully selected, based on their responses in the questionnaire, and interviewed. To gauge students' level of understanding of the equal sign, the construction map for knowledge of the equal sign developed by Matthews et al. was used, while the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching model proposed by Ball et al. was employed to interpret teachers' knowledge. Results indicate that few students had a well-developed relational conception of the equal sign. The majority of students could not describe the meaning of the equal sign correctly. The same group of students that applied `closure' was inclined to `use all the numbers in an equation'. Grade 5 and 6 teachers' Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching of the equal sign indicated that in general they lacked the knowledge and skills to identify, prevent, reduce or correct students' misconceptions about the equal sign.},

* Inclusion
Based on the three searches conducted and documented above, I gathered all initial search results into one Bibtex file, removed duplicates and adjusted and simplified Bibtex entries of each (following the format of firstauthorYear). This gave an initial collection of 86 potential articles to code for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were:
- nAfr (not from Africa)
- nEm (not empirical study)
- nMKT (not about mathematical knowledge for teaching)
