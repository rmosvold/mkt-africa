It seems from the research question that the problem is: What contributes to practice? When considering the methods, results and discussion, however, it appears that practice is not really studied. The problem should thus be: What teachers know?

When considering the research question, it appears that the type of study would be about influence of MKT on teaching (inf). However, when considering methods, results and discussion, it seems like practice is not studied, and the type would thus be other (oth).

** Problem
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: 4
:END:

The research questions focus on effects of the intervention (PD), so the problem would be: What PD?

It would thus be a study about development (dev)

Seems like this is a qualitative study (qal)
# Quite interesting to have a qualitative design with 125 teachers! 

Teachers were from different grade levels (all)

** Problem

Although the research question is formulated with a focus on teacher perceptions, I think the problem would be: What teachers know?
