:PROPERTIES:

It seems from the research question that the problem is: What contributes to practice? When considering the methods, results and discussion, however, it appears that practice is not really studied. The problem should thus be: What teachers know?

When considering the research question, it appears that the type of study would be about influence of MKT on teaching (inf). However, when considering methods, results and discussion, it seems like practice is not studied, and the type would thus be other (oth).
