After a full coding of the 30 articles that were considered for inclusion, I ended up with a final sample of 23 studies that were included. Below are overviews of each code.

Citations were found by looking up each individual article on Google Scholar. This was done on <2022-07-29 Fri>.

* Frequencies of codes

# I have made another pass at the included articles with a focus on instruments, since the initial coding here was lacking. 
Whereas Hoover et al. (2016) highlighted the promise of measures, it is striking to see that almost no studies from the African context used standardized measures to study mathematical knowledge for teaching. 

Some studies used items from national math certificate tests for teachers [[citep:&alex2019;&bansilal2014]], whereas others developed their own test – often based on existing measures [[cite:&bowie2019]].
# It appears to me that most seem to focus on CCK, but this needs to be further investigated! 

Only a couple of studies used existing instruments, like TPACK [[citep:&defreitas2019]] and COEMET [[citep:&feza2018]], which is an observation protocol.

After having grappled with how to code instruments, I decided to consider instruments in relation to the problem of the study.

Among the studies of what teachers know, most included some kind of mathematics content test. A couple of these were drawing upon some kind of national mathematics certificate test for teachers [[citep:&alex2019;&bansilal2014]], whereas many developed their own tests, often based on existing measures or frameworks [[citep:&bowie2019]]. Whereas many instruments had a primary focus on mathematical content, a few included some kind of scenario or teaching context [[citep:&feza2016]]. Although most studies in this category involved some kind of content test, there was also an example that included a self-report questionnaire [[citep:&jacinto2020]], and one that involved a questionnaire that focused on participants' perceptions [[citep:&kalobo2016]].

Six studies explored what PD or TE influence mathematical knowledge for teaching. Most of these studies used instruments that involved some kind of self-report, either through interviews [[citep:&msimango2020]], questionnaires [[citep:&helmbold2021]], portfolios [[citep:&jita2019]] or self-report journals [[citep:&fonseca2021]]. One study applied a standardized observation protocol (COEMET) to assess practice [[citep:&feza2018]], and one study used a mathematics content test [[citep:&fonseca2015]].

The two studies that explored what mathematical knowledge for teaching is both used a combination of interviews with questionnaires or observations [[citep:&makonye2020b;&mwadzaangati2019]]. Amont the two studies that investigated relationships between different aspects of knowledge, one of these used a standardized TPACK instrument [[citep:&defreitas2019]]. A study of what contributes to student learning used mathematics learner tests [[citep:&pournara2015]], a study of what contributes to practice used a combination of observations, interviews and other documentation like lesson plans [[citep:&spangenberg2021]], whereas a study of how mathematical knowledge for teaching developes used a combination of observations of interviews [[citep:&venkat2015]].

*** DONE Focus on CCK (and some PCK)
CLOSED: [2022-08-09 Tue 08:53]
After having reviewed studies of what teachers know, it struck me that most of them seemed to emphasize CCK. I decided to check out this hypothesis further.

[[cite:&alex2019]] used the SLDCK test, which focused on pure mathematics domains like:
- financial maths
- probability
- data handling
- analytical geometry
- trigonometry
- euclidean geometry
They do not include any sample items, but they disclose that “SLDCK talks about teachers' own understanding of the content they are expected to teach at a particular grade level” (p. 5), which indicates that the focus is on CCK.

[[cite:&bansilal2014]] used a shortened version of the “National Senior Certificate March 2010 supplementary examination” (p. 39). Items focused on:
- quadratic equations and inequalities
- patterns
- hyperbolic function
- parabolic function
- finding derivatives using rules
- optimisation
- linear programming
In the text, they illustrate that items involve regular mathematics problems like solving inequalities like $7x^2 + 18x - 9 > 0$, solving quadratic equations like $2x^2+3x-7=0$, and the like. Again, the focus appears to be on CCK.

[[cite:&bowie2019]] had items on:
- numbers and operations
- rational numbers
- patterns, functions and algebra
- geometry
- measurement
Again, sample items that are given indicate a focus on CCK. Some examples of items are to calculate $700-292$ and “Fill in the number to make the number sentence true $623-298=622-\Hsquare$” (p. 292).

[[cite:&setoromo2018]] refer directly to the categories of CCK, SCK, and KCT. Example items of CCK include: “List/Write down the even numbers that are between 1–20 in the space below” (p. 5) and “Write the following in number symbol: two hundred and fifty five” (p. 6). A follow up of the latter involved division with space to show their calculations. Example of an item that was categorized as SCK was: “What would you do when you have planned an activity for learners to count 5 objects and you discover that some learners find the task too easy?” (p. 7). An example KCT item is (p. 8):

#+begin_quote
For the statement below circle the response which you think is correct. When learners are given objects to count, the following common errors are likely to occur.

A. Learners will count without arranging objects sequentially.
B. They wil not skip some objects.
C. They may not be able to tell the total number of the objects.
D. They may continue counting endlessly.
E. They may repeatedly point at the same objects when counting. 
#+end_quote

[[cite:&siyepui2021]] included items that were intended to “assess students' understanding in developing conjectures for the total surface area of a cylinder” (p. 4), “assess pre-service teachers' understanding of the application of the formula for the total surface area of a cylinder” (p. 4), “assess pre-service teachers' understanding of basic concepts in solids” (p. 5), “assess pre-service student teachers' understanding of the formulae for calculating the areas of triangles and rectangles” (p. 5), and “assess pre-service student teachers' understanding of key concepts that determine formulae for the area of a cone ...” (p. 6). Although such items (in particular the last few) could be SCK items, the information given in the text indicates that all of these items were mostly CCK items. For instance, the authors report that several students understood how the area of a cone could be represented by a certain formula, but most students “could not calculate the total surface area of a cone correctly” (p. 11). This indicates that the items were focusing on CCK more than on SCK.

[[cite:&vermeulen2017]] also seem to include mostly CCK items. An example is (p. 144):

#+begin_quote
Alan started a problem with a one-digit number. He multiplied the number by 3, added 8, divided by 2 and subtracted 6, and got the same number he started with. What was the number Alan started with? (Show all working out)

a. 2
b. 4
c. 6
d. 8

After having completed coding, I decided to consider what theoretical framework or foundations that were used in studies.

Below, I use 0 or 1 to indicate if studies have unclear or theoretical framework (on MKT), and I then use 1 to indicate if a particular framework is primary, and 2 to indicate if it is a secondary framework (mentioned).

In summary, 13 out of the 23 studies was specific about their theoretical framework, whereas 10 did not have a clear framework, or were unclear about how they conceptualized mathematical knowledge for teaching.

For those who presented a clear theoretical framework, below is an overview of the primary and secondary theoretical frameworks:

| Frameworks | Primary | Secondary |
|------------+---------+-----------|
| MKT        |       8 |         6 |
| PCK        |       1 |        11 |
| COACTIV    |       1 |         2 |
| APOS       |       2 |           |
| TEDS-M     |         |         2 |
| TPACK      |       1 |           |

In other words, the by far most studies in this literature review had the MKT framework of Ball et al. (2008) as their primary theoretical framework, and several also emphasized this framwork when presenting their theoretical framework, although it was not their primary framework. Only one study had PCK as a theoretical framework [[citep:&msimango2020]], and they used the /Clearly/ PCK framework by Chick et al. (2006), but almost half of the studies emphasized the conceptualization of PCK (mostly with reference to Shulman). Almost all of the studies that had MKT as a primary framework emphasized its connections with Shulman's (1986, 1987) conceptualization of PCK. One study had COACTIV as their primary theoretical framework [[citep:&makonye2020b]], whereas two referred to this. Two studies applied the APOS theory of Dubinsky (1991) as their primary theoretical framework [[citep:&bansilal2014;&ubah2018]], whereas one used TPACK as their primary framework [[cite:&defreitas2019]]. Two studies gave prominence to the TEDS-M framework, but none of the studies in this review used it as a primary framework. 
# Caveat: Although studies were included in this review and thus considered to be about mathematical knowledge for teaching, they do not necessarily consider themselves to be studies of MKT. Comments about “unclear” framework thus need to be carefully formulated in the paper!
