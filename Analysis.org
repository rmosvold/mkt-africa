After a full coding of the 30 articles that were considered for inclusion, I ended up with a final sample of 23 studies that were included. Below are overviews of each code.

* Frequencies of codes
** Country
The overwhelming majority of studies were conducted in South Africa (20 out of 23 studies). Two studies were conducted in Malawi, and one was from Lesotho. 

| Country      | No. |
|--------------+-----|
| South Africa |  20 |
| Malawi       |   2 |
| Lesotho      |   1 |

** Genre
Almost half of the studies (n=10) had a focus on “other”, which in these cases indicated that they focused on evaluating teachers' knowledge. The underlying problem in these studies was: What teachers know?

| Genre       | No. |
|-------------+-----|
| Other       |  10 |
| Development |   7 |
| Nature      |   4 |
| Influence   |   2 |

** Causal design

| Type of causal design | No. |
|-----------------------+-----|
| Qualitative           |  15 |
| Statistical           |   8 |

** Sample size
There was an even distribution of studies in terms of their sample size. 

| Sample            | No. |
|-------------------+-----|
| Small-scale (<10) |   6 |
| Medium 1 (10–29)  |   6 |
| Medium 2 (30–70)  |   6 |
| Large (>70)       |   5 |

** Instrument
Whereas Hoover et al. (2016) highlighted the promise of measures, it is striking to see that almost no studies from the African context used standardized measures to study mathematical knowledge for teaching. 

** Level and teachers

| Level         | No. |
|---------------+-----|
| Primary       |  12 |
| Middle school |   2 |
| Secondary     |   5 |
| Tertiary      |   1 |
| All           |   3 |

| Teachers             | No. |
|----------------------+-----|
| Future teachers      |   8 |
| Practicing teachers  |  12 |
| Experienced teachers |   3 |

** Problem
Almost half of the studies were studies on what teachers know, and these studies tended to report on insufficient knowledge among teachers. 

| Problem                         | No. |
|---------------------------------+-----|
| What teachers know?             |  10 |
| What PD?                        |   4 |
| What TE?                        |   2 |
| What relationships?             |   2 |
| What is MKT?                    |   2 |
| Contribute to student learning? |   1 |
| What contributes to practice?   |   1 |
| How MKT develops?               |   1 |
