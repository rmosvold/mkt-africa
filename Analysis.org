After a full coding of the 30 articles that were considered for inclusion, I ended up with a final sample of 23 studies that were included. Below are overviews of each code.

Citations were found by looking up each individual article on Google Scholar. This was done on <2022-07-29 Fri>.

* Frequencies of codes
** Country
The overwhelming majority of studies were conducted in South Africa (20 out of 23 studies). Two studies were conducted in Malawi, and one was from Lesotho. 

| Country      | No. |
|--------------+-----|
| South Africa |  20 |
| Malawi       |   2 |
| Lesotho      |   1 |

** Genre
Almost half of the studies (n=10) had a focus on “other”, which in these cases indicated that they focused on evaluating teachers' knowledge. The underlying problem in these studies was: What teachers know?

| Genre       | No. |
|-------------+-----|
| Other       |  10 |
| Development |   7 |
| Nature      |   4 |
| Influence   |   2 |

** Causal design

| Type of causal design | No. |
|-----------------------+-----|
| Qualitative           |  15 |
| Statistical           |   8 |

** Sample size
There was an even distribution of studies in terms of their sample size. 

| Sample            | No. |

# I have made another pass at the included articles with a focus on instruments, since the initial coding here was lacking. 
Whereas Hoover et al. (2016) highlighted the promise of measures, it is striking to see that almost no studies from the African context used standardized measures to study mathematical knowledge for teaching. 

Some studies used items from national math certificate tests for teachers [[citep:&alex2019;&bansilal2014]], whereas others developed their own test – often based on existing measures [[cite:&bowie2019]].

Only a couple of studies used existing instruments, like TPACK [[citep:&defreitas2019]] and COEMET [[citep:&feza2018]], which is an observation protocol.

After having grappled with how to code instruments, I decided to consider instruments in relation to the problem of the study.

Among the studies of what teachers know, most included some kind of mathematics content test. A couple of these were drawing upon some kind of national mathematics certificate test for teachers [[citep:&alex2019;&bansilal2014]], whereas many developed their own tests, often based on existing measures or frameworks [[citep:&bowie2019]]. Whereas many instruments had a primary focus on mathematical content, a few included some kind of scenario or teaching context [[citep:&feza2016]]. Although most studies in this category involved some kind of content test, there was also an example that included a self-report questionnaire [[citep:&jacinto2020]], and one that involved a questionnaire that focused on participants' perceptions [[citep:&kalobo2016]].

Six studies explored what PD or TE influence mathematical knowledge for teaching. Most of these studies used instruments that involved some kind of self-report, either through interviews [[citep:&msimango2020]], questionnaires [[citep:&helmbold2021]], portfolios [[citep:&jita2019]] or self-report journals [[citep:&fonseca2021]]. One study applied a standardized observation protocol (COEMET) to assess practice [[citep:&feza2018]], and one study used a mathematics content test [[citep:&fonseca2015]].

The two studies that explored what mathematical knowledge for teaching is both used a combination of interviews with questionnaires or observations [[citep:&makonye2020b;&mwadzaangati2019]]. Amont the two studies that investigated relationships between different aspects of knowledge, one of these used a standardized TPACK instrument [[citep:&defreitas2019]]. A study of what contributes to student learning used mathematics learner tests [[citep:&pournara2015]], a study of what contributes to practice used a combination of observations, interviews and other documentation like lesson plans [[citep:&spangenberg2021]], whereas a study of how mathematical knowledge for teaching developes used a combination of observations of interviews [[citep:&venkat2015]].
