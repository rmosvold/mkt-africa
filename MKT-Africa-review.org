* Introduction
After several decades of process-product research, [[cite:&shulman1986]] identified the lack of content-focus as a “missing paradign” in research on teaching. His distinction between content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge indicated that there are several types of knowledge of content that are special to teaching. Following Shulman, there has been a continually growing body of research that investigates various aspects of content knowledge for teaching. In mathematics education, we often refer to this as mathematical knowledge for teaching. Although this term is often used with reference to the mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) framework of [[cite:&balletal2008]], arguably among the most commonly used frameworks in this field of research, we use it here in more generic terms.

Research on mathematical knowledge for teaching is flourishing, and the fact that a key publication like that of [[cite:&balletal2008]] has over 9000 citations, at the time of writing this, testifies to this. In their review of research on mathematical knowledge for teaching, [[cite:&hoover2016]] analysed 190 journal articles that were published on this topic between 2006 and 2013. The majority of those articles were published in North America, Asia and Europe, and only seven of the articles in that review were from Africa. In a more careful examination of this subset of studies on mathematical knowledge for teaching from Africa, [[cite:&jakobsen2015]] suggest that more research is needed, in particular on the primary level and among pre-service teachers. They also noticed that few studies used standardised measures, and they suggested that more studies of mathematical knowledge for teaching in Africa should use existing measures. Based on these previous reviews, the present study revisits and reviews research more recent research on mathematical knowledge for teaching in Africa, focusing on research that has been published between 2014 and 2021. The following research question is approached:

* Previous studies
To provide some more context, the present section briefly describes some main tendencies in previous research on mathematical knowledge for teaching in Africa – drawing primarily upon the review by [[cite:&jakobsen2015]].

In their review of African studies of mathematical knowledge for teaching between 2006 and 2013, [[cite:&jakobsen2015]] noticed that most studies were small-scale qualitative studies – only one study was large-scale and applied quantitative methods – and none of the studies used existing measures of mathematical knowledge for teaching. Five of the studies were from South Africa, whereas one study was from Botswana and one was from Mozambique. Three of the most significant studies reported from a large project (the QUANTUM project) of middle school and secondary school mathematics teachers in South Africa. One of these studies elaborated on what is involved in “unpacking” the mathematical work of teaching [[citep:&adler2006]]. In another study, [[cite:&adler2010]] discussed two interrelated tasks of teaching to develop an argument that the design and mediation of tasks are particularly important aspects of mathematical knowledge for teaching. In the third publication from the QUANTUM project, [[cite:&kazima2008]] argued that mathematical knowledge for teaching is related to the content being taught, and they explored the tasks of defining, explaining, representing, working with students' ideas, restructuring tasks and questioning. 

Whereas the three studies from the QUANTUM project all focused on exploring the nature of mathematical knowledge for teaching, other studies investigated what teachers know and how their knowledge influence practice. In a large-scale study, [[cite:&sapire2012]] explored how mathematical knowledge for teaching influenced the quality of mathematics teaching among teachers in Botswana and South Africa. They concluded that teachers were lacking in pedagogical content knowledge, and they mainly applied tasks of low cognitive level in their teaching. In another study, [[cite:&bansilal2012]] explored how the poor content knowledge of an experienced teacher influenced her teaching.

In addition, two studies in the review of [[cite:&jakobsen2015]] attended to the influence of teacher education and professional development on mathematical knowledge for teaching. [[cite:&pournara2009]] explored how spreadsheets, as introduced in a course in financial mathematics for South African pre-service teachers, could positively influence the work of teaching mathematics. Finally, in yet another article from the QUANTUM project, [[cite:&huillet2011]] reported on how a professional development project like this might influence the development of mathematical knowledge for teaching. 

* Methods
# Below is a first rough draft of the methods section <2022-08-11 Thu>.
The present review builds on the previous review of literature on mathematical knowledge for teaching by [[cite:&hoover2016]], which studied literature from the period between 2006 and 2013. The African studies from that review were discussed more in depth by [[cite:&jakobsen2015]]. 

** Search
The search for articles was conducted in three stages. First, a broad search was conducted in the Eric database for peer reviewed journal articles that included the search terms “mathematical knowledge for teaching” and “Africa”. This search gave nine results. A second and more extensive search was conducted in Eric for peer-reviewed journal articles in English that were published between 2014 and 2021. Search terms were “mathematics AND knowledge AND teaching” in the abstract, and in addition “Africa” as a location identifier. This search gave 72 articles. To avoid missing some important studies, manual searches were conducted in the archives of two prominent African journals in mathematics education: /African Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education/ (AJRMSTE) and /Pythagoras/. These manual searches gave 15 hits in AJRMSTE, 11 of which were published after 2014. The search in /Pythagoras/ gave 31 hits.

** Inclusion
From the searches described above, all search results were collected, and duplicates were removed. The result was 82 articles for potential inclusion in the review. The abstracts of these articles were then coded, in order to decide if the study was 1) an empirical study, that 2) investigated mathematical knowledge for teaching – broadly interpreted. After this initial coding phase, 30 studies were considered for inclusion. Some articles were excluded in this phase because they were theoretical articles [[citep:&askew2020]], and some were excluded because they were reviews of previous research and not empirical studies themselves [[citep:&adler2017]]. Most studies were excluded because they were not about mathematical knowledge for teaching. Many studies focused on learners or learners' knowledge rather than mathematical knowledge for teaching [[citep:&engelbrecht2015]], other studies focused on teaching practice or particular approaches to teaching [[citep:&ubah2021]], whereas some were studies of textbooks or curriculum studies [[citep:&bowie2016]].

The next step was to get the full text of the 30 articles that were potentially included, and the full text of each of these articles were then coded. Through this phase of coding full texts of the articles, some additional articles were excluded because the studies did not turn out to have a primary focus on mathematical knowledge for teaching after all [[citep:&chigonga2019;&dhurumraj2020;&joubert2020;&ngema2019;&setoromo2020;&sibanda2021;&tachie2019]]. The final number of studies that were included in the review was thus N=23. 

** Coding
Based on the previous review of [[cite:&hoover2016]], the articles were coded in terms of the following codes:
- Genre of study
- Causal design of the studies
- Underlying problem that motivated studies
- Sample size
- Instruments that were used to study mathematical knowledge for teaching
- Level of teachers or settings that were studied
- Stage or experience of teachers
- What country the study was conducted in

In addition, notes were taken about what lessons were learned from each study, and the number of citations for each article was also recorded.   

To exemplify the coding, the study by [[cite:&defreitas2019]] was coded to be a study that is primarily about studying the construct of mathematical knowledge for teaching (nature). It primarily used statistical data to show causality, and the underlying problem was coded to be “What relationships?” In other words, the underlying problem emphasised the relationships between different aspects of mathematical knowledge for teaching. This was a large-scale study (n=93), which applied the TPACK instrument to investigate mathematical knowledge for teaching among teachers in grades 7–9 (corresponding with middle school in the coding), and these were practicing teachers. The study was conducted in South Africa, and the article had 19 citations in Google Scholar at the time of coding. 

** Analysis
Based on the coding of each article, frequencies of codes were generated to further investigate patterns across the studies. An additional round of analysis was conducted concerning the instrument of studies, since the initial coding indicated that few studies applied particular instruments with scores. More descriptive codes of the methods of study were developed inductively to provide a more meaningful overview of how the studies investigated mathematical knowledge for teaching. Through this phase of inductive coding of the methods of study, I also decided to consider the theoretical or analytic frameworks that were applied in the studies. These last two aspects of the analysis deviated from the previous review of [[cite:&hoover2016]], but were considered relevant for this review.

To increase trustworthiness and transparency – and to provide a resource for other researchers – the entire process of this literature review has been documented extensively and all source files are available in a public Github repository. 

* Results
# In this first version of the results section, I start with the notes and tables from the analysis <2022-08-11 Thu>.

** Country
The overwhelming majority of studies were conducted in South Africa (20 out of 23 studies). Two studies were conducted in Malawi, and one was from Lesotho.

** Frameworks
After having completed coding, I decided to consider what theoretical framework or foundations that were used in studies.

Below, I use 0 or 1 to indicate if studies have unclear or theoretical framework (on MKT), and I then use 1 to indicate if a particular framework is primary, and 2 to indicate if it is a secondary framework (mentioned).

In summary, 13 out of the 23 studies was specific about their theoretical framework, whereas 10 did not have a clear framework, or were unclear about how they conceptualized mathematical knowledge for teaching.

For those who presented a clear theoretical framework, below is an overview of the primary and secondary theoretical frameworks:

| Frameworks | Primary | Secondary |
|------------+---------+-----------|
| MKT        |       8 |         6 |
| PCK        |       1 |        11 |
| COACTIV    |       1 |         2 |
| APOS       |       2 |           |
| TEDS-M     |         |         2 |
| TPACK      |       1 |           |

In other words, the by far most studies in this literature review had the MKT framework of Ball et al. (2008) as their primary theoretical framework, and several also emphasized this framwork when presenting their theoretical framework, although it was not their primary framework. Only one study had PCK as a theoretical framework [[citep:&msimango2020]], and they used the /Clearly/ PCK framework by Chick et al. (2006), but almost half of the studies emphasized the conceptualization of PCK (mostly with reference to Shulman). Almost all of the studies that had MKT as a primary framework emphasized its connections with Shulman's (1986, 1987) conceptualization of PCK. One study had COACTIV as their primary theoretical framework [[citep:&makonye2020b]], whereas two referred to this. Two studies applied the APOS theory of Dubinsky (1991) as their primary theoretical framework [[citep:&bansilal2014;&ubah2018]], whereas one used TPACK as their primary framework [[cite:&defreitas2019]]. Two studies gave prominence to the TEDS-M framework, but none of the studies in this review used it as a primary framework. 
# Caveat: Although studies were included in this review and thus considered to be about mathematical knowledge for teaching, they do not necessarily consider themselves to be studies of MKT. Comments about “unclear” framework thus need to be carefully formulated in the paper!

** Instrument
After having grappled with how to code instruments, I decided to consider instruments in relation to the problem of the study.

| No. | Citation               | Instrument                          | Problem                         |

Among the studies of what teachers know, most included some kind of mathematics content test. A couple of these were drawing upon some kind of national mathematics certificate test for teachers [[citep:&alex2019;&bansilal2014]], whereas many developed their own tests, often based on existing measures or frameworks [[citep:&bowie2019]]. Whereas many instruments had a primary focus on mathematical content, a few included some kind of scenario or teaching context [[citep:&feza2016]]. Although most studies in this category involved some kind of content test, there was also an example that included a self-report questionnaire [[citep:&jacinto2020]], and one that involved a questionnaire that focused on participants' perceptions [[citep:&kalobo2016]].

Six studies explored what PD or TE influence mathematical knowledge for teaching. Most of these studies used instruments that involved some kind of self-report, either through interviews [[citep:&msimango2020]], questionnaires [[citep:&helmbold2021]], portfolios [[citep:&jita2019]] or self-report journals [[citep:&fonseca2021]]. One study applied a standardized observation protocol (COEMET) to assess practice [[citep:&feza2018]], and one study used a mathematics content test [[citep:&fonseca2015]].

The two studies that explored what mathematical knowledge for teaching is both used a combination of interviews with questionnaires or observations [[citep:&makonye2020b;&mwadzaangati2019]]. Amont the two studies that investigated relationships between different aspects of knowledge, one of these used a standardized TPACK instrument [[citep:&defreitas2019]]. A study of what contributes to student learning used mathematics learner tests [[citep:&pournara2015]], a study of what contributes to practice used a combination of observations, interviews and other documentation like lesson plans [[citep:&spangenberg2021]], whereas a study of how mathematical knowledge for teaching developes used a combination of observations of interviews [[citep:&venkat2015]].

* Discussion
** Main focus on what teachers know
# Common story of teachers lacking knowledge

** Frameworks
# Many use MKT, but several have unclear framework/conceptualization of MKT

** Few use standardized measures
# Emphasized by Hoover et al. (2016)
